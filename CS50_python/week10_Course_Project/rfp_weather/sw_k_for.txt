A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 16-Feb 18 2023 is 6.00 (NOAA Scale
G2).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 16-Feb 18 2023

             Feb 16       Feb 17       Feb 18
00-03UT       5.00 (G1)    2.67         6.00 (G2)
03-06UT       4.33         3.00         5.33 (G1)
06-09UT       3.00         2.00         4.00     
09-12UT       2.67         2.00         3.33     
12-15UT       2.33         2.33         3.00     
15-18UT       2.00         4.00         2.33     
18-21UT       2.33         5.00 (G1)    3.00     
21-00UT       3.00         5.00 (G1)    3.67     

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is expected to reach G1 (Minor) storm
levels on 16 Feb due to CME influence. Late on 17 Feb, G1 (Minor)
geomagnetic storming is likely to commence with the arrival of a CME
from 15 Feb. Conditions are likely to increase to G2 (Moderate) storm
levels on 18 Feb.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 16-Feb 18 2023

              Feb 16  Feb 17  Feb 18
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 15 2023 0523 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 16-Feb 18 2023

              Feb 16        Feb 17        Feb 18
R1-R2           45%           35%           25%
R3 or greater   10%            5%            5%

Rationale: There is a chance for R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts
on 16-18 Feb with fewer complex regions remaining on the visible disk
today. There is only a slight chance any of the ten active regions would
produce a flare large enough to initiate R3 (Strong) or greater radio
blackouts.
