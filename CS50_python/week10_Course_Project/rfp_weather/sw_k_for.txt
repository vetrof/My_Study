A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 09-Feb 11 2023 is 4.00 (below NOAA
Scale levels).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 09-Feb 11 2023

             Feb 09       Feb 10       Feb 11
00-03UT       3.33         2.67         1.67

21-00UT       2.67         2.33         1.67     

Rationale: No G1 (Minor) or greater geomagnetic storms are expected.  No
significant transient or recurrent solar wind features are forecast.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 09-Feb 11 2023

              Feb 09  Feb 10  Feb 11
S1 or greater    1%      1%      1%

Rationale: No S1 (Minor) or greater solar radiation storms are expected.
No significant active region activity favorable for radiation storm
production is forecast.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 09 2023 0310 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 09-Feb 11 2023

              Feb 09        Feb 10        Feb 11
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   15%           15%           15%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, and
there is a slight chance for R3 (Strong) or greater radio blackouts on
09-11 Feb due to the flare potential of Regions 3213 and 3217.
