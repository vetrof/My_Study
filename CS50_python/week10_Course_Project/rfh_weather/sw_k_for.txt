A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 5 (NOAA Scale
G1).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Feb 15-Feb 17 2023 is 5.33 (NOAA Scale
G1).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Feb 15-Feb 17 2023

             Feb 15       Feb 16       Feb 17
00-03UT       3.00         2.33         1.67

18-21UT       3.00         1.67         1.67     
21-00UT       3.33         2.00         1.33     

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms are expected on 15 Feb due to
CME influences.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-16 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Feb 15-Feb 17 2023

              Feb 15  Feb 16  Feb 17
S1 or greater   10%      1%      1%

Rationale: There is a slight chance for the greater than 10 MeV proton
flux to reach S1 (Minor) levels on 15 Feb primarily due to the flare
potential and favorable location of Region 3213.

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Feb 15 2023 0523 UTC.

Radio Blackout Forecast for Feb 15-Feb 17 2023

              Feb 15        Feb 16        Feb 17
R1-R2           55%           50%           50%
R3 or greater   10%           10%           10%

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are likely on 15 Feb
with numerous active regions remaining on the disk, decreasing to a
chance by 16 Feb as Region 3214 rotates off the disk. There is also a
slight chance for stronger flares, particularly from Region 3226, which
would be capable of producing R3 (Strong) or greater radio blackouts.
